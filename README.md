### â€• Hi there, I'm [GiosuÃ¨](https://giosuesulipano.it)! ðŸ‘‹

```java
public String greet() {
  return "Hey, what's up?";
}
```

I'm a Master's Student at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Salerno, in love with everything related to computers. I usually make things to learn something new, using different technologies and most of the time they're a public repository.

Feel free to ask me anything <a href="https://github.com/imgios/imgios/issues">here</a> or drop me an <a href="mailto:g.sulipano@outlook.it?subject=Hi, GiosuÃ¨!">email</a> if you want to keep it private!
